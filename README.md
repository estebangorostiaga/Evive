# Evive

This is my solution to the Evive Engineering Test in C++. You may not use this code if you intend to pass it as your own.

# How to Test the code

1. First download all the necessary .cpp and .h files, along with the Tests folder. You may clone the repository to download all the necessary files.
2. Make sure the G++ compiler works and is updated.
3. Use this command to build and compile the application: g++ -std=c++11 -g -Werror -o main *.cpp
4. Run it with ./main Tests/Test#.txt where # is the Test # you wish to run. 
    (E.g ./main Tests/Test1.txt)

# Tests folder

This folder includes all the tests given in the "Evive Engineering Test 2021" and others that I included for testing purposes.
