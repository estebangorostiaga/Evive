# Evive

This is my solution to the Evive Engineering Test in C++. You may not use this code if you intend to pass as it your own.

# How to Test the code

1. First download all the necessary .cpp and .h files, along with the Tests folder.
2. Make sure the G++ compiler works and is updated
3. Use this command to build and compile the application: g++ -std=c++11 -g -Werror -o main *.cpp
4. Run it with ./main Tests/Test#.txt where # is the Test # you wish to run. 
    (E.g ./main Tests/Test1.txt)
